# v0.7.4 (2024-02-24)
## üöÄ Breaking Changes
eCapture supports [Pcap Filter Syntax] (https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap-filter.7.html), and you can use the pcap filter expression to filter network packets like tcpdump.

In the tls\gotls module, when the running mode is 'pcap', the pcap filter expression is supported, which can be set in the last parameter of the command line, for example:

# v0.7.0 (2023-12-03)
## üöÄ Breaking Changes
- Split `nss/gnutls/openssl` into three separate submodules. Corresponding to the `./ecapture nss`, `./ecapture gnutls`, `ecapture tls` commands.
- Support `keylog` mode, equivalent to the functionality of the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` environment variable. Captures SSL/TLS communication keys directly without the need for changes in the target process.
- Refactor the mode parameters supported by the `openssl`(aka tls) module using the `-m`parameter, with values `text`, `pcap`,`keylog`.
  - `pcap` mode: Set with `-m pcap` or `-m pcapng` parameters. When using this mode, it is necessary to specify `--pcapfile` and `-i` parameters. The default value for the `--pcapfile` parameter is `ecapture_openssl.pcapng`.
  - `keylog` mode: Set with `-m keylog` or `-m key` parameters. When using this mode, it is necessary to specify `--keylogfile`, defaulting to `ecapture_masterkey.log`.
  - `text` mode: Default mode when `-m` parameter is unspecified. Outputs all plaintext packets in text form. (As of v0.7.0, no longer captures communication keys, please use `keylog` mode instead.)
- Refactor the mode parameters supported by the `gotls` module, similar to the `openssl` module, without further details.
- Optimize the memory size of eBPF Map, specify with the `--mapsize` parameter, defaulting to 5120 KB.
- Remove the `-w` parameter, use `--pcapfile` parameter instead.
- Change `log-addr` parameter to `logaddr`, with unchanged functionality.

Thanks to the genius idea from @blaisewang.

### Demo of keylog Mode Usage
Using eCapture to capture communication keys in real-time and combining it with tshark for real-time decryption enables the real-time plaintext output of encrypted traffic. The steps are as follows:

‰ΩøÁî®`eCapture`ÂÆûÊó∂ÊçïËé∑ÈÄö‰ø°ÂØÜÈí•ÔºåÂπ∂ÁªìÂêà`tshark`ÂÆûÊó∂Ëß£ÂØÜÔºåÂèØ‰ª•ÂÅöÂà∞ÂÆûÊó∂ÁöÑÂä†ÂØÜÊµÅÈáèÊòéÊñáËæìÂá∫„ÄÇÊ≠•È™§Â¶Ç‰∏ãÔºö

#### Terminal 1
Start the keylog mode of eCapture first.

ÂÖàÂêØÂä®eCaptureÁöÑ`keylog`Ê®°Âºè

```shell
ecapture tls -m keylog --keylogfile=ecapture_masterkey.log
```

### Terminal 2
Start the tshark tool by specifying tls.keylog_file as the captured key file by eCapture, named ecapture_masterkey.

ÂÜçÂêØÂä®`tshark`Â∑•ÂÖ∑ÔºåÊåáÂÆö`tls.keylog_file`‰∏∫eCaptureÊçïËé∑ÁöÑÂØÜÈí•Êñá‰ª∂`ecapture_masterkey`

**http 1.x**
```shell
tshark -o tls.keylog_file:ecapture_masterkey.log -Y http -T fields -e http.file_data -f "port 443" -i eth0
```

**http 2.0**
```shell
tshark -o tls.keylog_file:ecapture_masterkey.log -Y http2 -T fields -e http2.data.data -f "port 443" -i eth0
```
Afterward, any software that uses the eCapture HOOK with OpenSSL libraries can achieve real-time decryption and display of all encrypted communication traffic without requiring any modifications to these software applications.

# v0.4.0 (2022-08-07)

## Breaking Changes

**Support : capture plaintext packet as pcapng files for openssl TLS encryption.**

> **Note:**
>
> Support `Wireshark` to open directly. Do not need to setting up `Master Secrets` files.
>
> Capture `raw packet` by Traffic Control eBPF filter. Added `Master Secrets` information into pcapng
> with `Decryption Secrets Block` (DSB).

> **Warning**
>
> change `loggerFile` flag as `-l` from `-w` , because `-w` is reserved for `Wireshark`, and keep same as `-w`
> for `tcpdump`. use `ecapture -h` for help.
> change `master secrets` filename from `ecapture_masterkey_[pid].log` to `ecapture_masterkey.log`.

## Breaking Changes

**Capture TLS master_key ,save to file. Support openssl `1.1.1.X` . `TLS 1.2` .**

Quick Guide:

- use `ecapture` to capture TLS master_key, will save master secret to `ecapture_masterkey_[pid].log`.
- use `tcpdump` to capture and save packets to `xxx.pcapng` file.
- open `xxx.pcapng` file with `wireshark`.
- Setting : `Wireshark` --> `Preferences` -->  `Protocols` --> `TLS` --> `(Pre)-Master-Secret log filename`, select `ecapture_masterkey_[pid].log`.
- Using : right click packet item, select `follow` -> `HTTP Stream` / `HTTP/2 Stream`
